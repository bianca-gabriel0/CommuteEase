        Public transportation in Dagupan City, Pangasinan, is widely used by workers, students, 
        and residents, but commuters often face uncertain bus and jeepney schedules. This leads 
        to wasted time, long queues, and overcrowded vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        CommuteEase provide Dagupan commuters with a clear and accessible timetable system. By 
        allowing users to see which buses or jeepneys are available at specific times—and which 
        departures are coming within the next few minutes—the system helps make daily commuting 
        more efficient and less stressful.
